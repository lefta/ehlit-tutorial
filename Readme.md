# Ehlit - Tutorial

Quick tutorial to get the [Ehlit](https://github.com/lefta/ehlit-prototype) language in hand
quickly.

It is meant for developpers already knowing at least one language, and knowing all standard
concepts of programming languages. At least major concepts of OOP are expected to be known, as they
will not be explained.

Note that this collection of documents is still a work in progress. Some mistakes may be hiding here
and there, there may be informations about yet unimplemented features or in the contrary, some
features already implemented may be lacking.
